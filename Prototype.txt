woiec1_03=Whatever had changed me... erased my past…must have started there.
woiec1_04=I thought if I could find out who was running Gentek, before Blackwatch erased them too, I could find my past.

woiec2_03=I know now...freeing Elizabeth Greene was a mistake.  She was a monster, infecting everything she touched. 
woiec2_04=Get to Greene, find out who did this to me.  I thought that she was the key to all of this. 
woiec2_05=And was she?
woiec2_06=In a way.
woiec2_07=I knew we were connected.  Victims of a common enemy?  Subjects of a common experiment?  I didn't know.

woiec3_01=Everything was getting worse.  There were outbreaks across the city.  There were Hunters now, thanks to Greene. Blackwatch quarantined the island.
woiec3_02=It became clear to me that McMullen - GENTEK's director of research - had linked us all together.
woiec3_03=He worked for Blackwatch. He had studied Greene. Karen and I had worked for him - you know, before.
woiec3_04=He knew who I was - and maybe - what had happened to me.
woiec3_05=I thought: when I find McMullen I find myself.
woiec3_06=Well, what did he tell you?
woiec3_07=McMullen? Lots of things.

woiec4_02=By the time I discovered she was working for Blackwatch, she was gone.
woiec4_03=But I had a bigger problem - a weaponized cancer was eating me from the inside out.
woiec4_04=I needed a doctor.  A special kind of doctor. I needed Ragland.
woiec4_05=How did it feel to be infected with something you couldn't control?
woiec4_06=Like my own body wanted me dead.

woiec5_01=I had no idea why Greene took my sister.  Revenge?  Bait for a trap?  All I knew was I had to get her back.
woiec5_02=These Infected are like animals. But there’s something more - like a hidden hand, guiding them.  
woiec5_02b=The hive mind became my only chance. It was a clue to find Dana and I thought by consuming infected minds, I could follow the link - and that would lead me to the one that took her.
woiec5_05=But then I realized...  I had the means... I had Blackwatch cornered.  I had their cancer weapon.  
woiec5_05b=I could put a stop to this right at the source if I could just get close enough to Greene.
woiec5_06=So I find Dana, kill Greene, stop the madness. Seemed worth a shot.
woiec5_07= Look at your handiwork now.
woiec5_08=Oh yeah.  They're headless.  An infected army without a leader.
woiec5_09=It's only a matter of time before they're wiped out.

woiec6_03=Part of me was relieved.   Part of me died.
woiec6_04=Just another disguise, right?  So ingrained, so real even I believe it.
woiec6_06=I realized then, I was a part of it all; an offshoot of the virus that struck Hope in '69. 
woiec6_06b=Blacklight. But there was a secret buried even deeper.
woiec6_07=When you contacted me, I had no other option. You were an insider. I was sure you could give me the answer.
woiec6_08=What was the secret?
woiec6_09=Penn Station was ground zero, not Elizabeth Greene.  Whoever triggered the infection… whoever did this to me…

woiec7_02=Hope was a Blackwatch project.  The goal of the experiment was to create a viral weapon that could be used to target specific racial types.
woiec7_03=But Hope went wrong.  A mutated virus infected all of those people - drove them mad.  
woiec7_03b=Their bodies crawled with hell.  And at the centre of it all was Elizabeth Greene.
woiec7_04=Somehow she had survived, endured the virus, absorbed it, changed it, whatever.  
woiec7_04b=Her unique biology inspired this new bioweapons research program. 
woiec7_04c= This became GENTEK -- and Alex Mercer worked for them.
woiec7_05=There was one leak too many and Randall stepped in to shut it down.   No one was safe.  Mercer fled the scene with a sample of the virus.  Took it as insurance if he needed it.
woiec7_06=Blackwatch cornered him at Penn Station.  With his back to the wall, he unleashed the virus on Manhattan.   
woiec7_07=What Mercer did is beyond forgiveness.
woiec7_10=But there is no Alex Mercer any more. The virus didn’t just kill him, it became him; copied his body down to the genetic level. It became me.
woiec7_11=I AM THE VIRUS.   And I, in turn, released Elizabeth Greene - to infect the city a second time.
woiec7_12=Now she's dead, but Randall won't accept that the virus can be stopped. With FIREBREAK he'll level the city - just like Hope.
woiec7_13=But now Hope has one final riddle to give up.  Greene was pregnant when they found her in '69. What happened to that child?
woiec7_14=Do you suppose your answer is out there on the Reagan?
woiec7_15=All I know is: I'll get my answer from Randall.
